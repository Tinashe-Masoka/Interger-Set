# Interger-Set
This C program implements a dynamic set management system with two sets (x_set and y_set). Users can add, print, remove elements, and compute the union or intersection of the sets. The program supports commands for these operations and automatically expands set capacity when needed. Input-driven, it continues running until the user quits with 'q'.
